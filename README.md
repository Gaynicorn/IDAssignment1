# ID Portfolio

This website is a portfolio about myself. The user is able to learn about me, what I love and also about the works that I do and produce. They can also contact me and find my contact information in the website.
 
## Design Process

- As an employer, I would like to click on the contact page to accesss the contact information and send a message to the owner.
- As an employer, I would like to click on the instagram and linkedin icon to see more works of the owner and what achievements he has accomplished.
