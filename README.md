# ID Portfolio

This website is a portfolio about myself. The user is able to learn about me, what I love and also about the works that I do and produce. They can also contact me and find my contact information in the website.
 
## Design Process

- As an employer, I would like to click on the contact page to accesss the contact information and send a message to the owner.
- As an employer, I would like to click on the instagram and linkedin icon to see more works of the owner and what achievements he has accomplished.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
